# mcimpos
A Minecraft port of Among Us

## What is this?
This is a Spigot server plugin, bringing an Among Us-like game to Minecraft.  
Of course, this is no where as great as the actual Among Us. I *really* push supporting Innersloth as they worked _**VERY**_ hard on their game.

## Prequisites
Java 17 + a~ 1.18(.1) server  
This requires **LuckPerms** and **RedLib** to function. This may be removed in the future with permission checks, but for now it's required.  

## What does this offer?
Core Among Us functions have been implemented into this plugin.  
This includes tasks, a sabotaging method (lights), kills and of course winning.  
Coming will include viewable stats and better managed systems. However, it is workable.

## What's to come?
This is a long list, get ready. Anything that is crossed off has been implemented.
Some of whats to come is;
- Venting (PARTIALLY done. Electric to MedBay)
- ..and a *lot* more. If you have any feature suggestions, open an issue.

## How do I install this?
For you simpletons: you can click the **Releases** tab and download the JAR directly.  
  
For you people who like a little challenge; this is a simple Maven project. You can clone & compile yourselves.  
```
git clone https://github.com/awexthedev/mcimpos.git
cd mcimpos
mvn clean package
```  
..and bam, you're done.
