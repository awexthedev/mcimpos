# mcimpos
A Minecraft port of Among Us

## What is this?
This is a Spigot server plugin, bringing an Among Us-like game to Minecraft.  
Of course, this is no where as great as the actual Among Us. I *really* push supporting Innersloth as they worked _**VERY**_ hard on their game.

## Prequisites
Java 17 + a~ 1.18(.1) server  
This requires **LuckPerms** to function. This may be removed in the future with permission checks, but for now it's required.  

## What does this offer?
Due to it being *very* new, it's missing a *lot*. Whats planned is below, but currently;
- teams, built for parties around 5 at the moment
- starting/stopping games via LuckPerms integration
- some tasks, some of which are being actively recreated

## What's to come?
This is a long list, get ready.  
Some of whats to come is;
- Sabatoging
- Better death management
- More tasks, ex. asteroids
- Removal of manual admin check
- ..and a *lot* more. If you have any feature suggestions, open an issue.

## How do I install this?
For you simpletons: you can click the **Releases** tab and download the JAR directly.  
  
For you people who like a little challenge; this is a simple Maven project. You can clone & compile yourselves.  
```
git clone https://github.com/awexthedev/mcimpos.git
cd mcimpos
mvn clean package
```  
..and bam, you're done.
